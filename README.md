# ParseCsv

ParseCsv is an easy-to-use PHP class that reads and writes CSV data properly. It
fully conforms to the specifications outlined on the on the
[Wikipedia article][CSV] (and thus RFC 4180). It has many advanced features which help make your
life easier when dealing with CSV data.

You may not need a library at all: before using ParseCsv, please make sure if PHP's own `str_getcsv()`, ``fgetcvs()`` or `fputcsv()` meets your needs.

This library was originally created in early 2007 by [jimeh](https://github.com/jimeh) due to the lack of built-in
and third-party support for handling CSV data in PHP.

## Features

* ParseCsv is a complete and fully featured CSV solution for PHP
* Supports enclosed values, enclosed commas, double quotes and new lines.
* Automatic delimiter character detection.
* Sort data by specific fields/columns.
* Easy data manipulation.
* Basic SQL-like _conditions_, _offset_ and _limit_ options for filtering
  data.
* Error detection for incorrectly formatted input. It attempts to be
  intelligent, but can not be trusted 100% due to the structure of CSV, and
  how different programs like Excel for example outputs CSV data.
* Support for character encoding conversion using PHP's
  `iconv()` and `mb_convert_encoding()` functions.
* Supports PHP 5.4 and higher.
  It certainly works with PHP 7.2 and all versions in between.

## Installation

Installation is easy using Composer. Just run the following on the
command line:
```
composer require parsecsv/php-parsecsv
```

If you don't use a framework such as Drupal, Laravel, Symfony, Yii etc.,
you may have to manually include Composer's autoloader file in your PHP
script:
```php
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
```

#### Without composer
Not recommended, but technically possible: you can also clone the
repository or extract the
[ZIP](https://github.com/parsecsv/parsecsv-for-php/archive/master.zip).
To use ParseCSV, you then have to add a `require 'parsecsv.lib.php';` line.

## Example Usage

**General**

```php
$csv = new ParseCsv\Csv('data.csv');
print_r($csv->data);
```

**Tab delimited, and encoding conversion**

```php
$csv = new ParseCsv\Csv();
$csv->encoding('UTF-16', 'UTF-8');
$csv->delimiter = "\t";
$csv->parse('data.tsv');
print_r($csv->data);
```

**Auto-detect delimiter character**

```php
$csv = new ParseCsv\Csv();
$csv->auto('data.csv');
print_r($csv->data);
```

**Parse data with offset**
* ignoring the first X (e.g. two) rows
```php
$csv = new ParseCsv\Csv();
$csv->offset = 2;
$csv->parse('data.csv');
print_r($csv->data);
```

**Limit the number of returned data rows**
```php
$csv = new ParseCsv\Csv();
$csv->limit = 5;
$csv->parse('data.csv');
print_r($csv->data);
```

**Get total number of data rows without parsing whole data**
* Excluding heading line if present (see $csv->header property)
```php
$csv = new ParseCsv\Csv();
$csv->load_data('data.csv');
$count = $csv->getTotalRowCount();
print_r($count);
```

**Get most common data type for each column (Requires PHP >= 5.5)**

```php
$csv = new ParseCsv\Csv('data.csv');
$csv->getDatatypes()
print_r($csv->data_types);
```

**Modify data in a CSV file**

```php
$csv = new ParseCsv\Csv();
$csv->sort_by = 'id';
$csv->parse('data.csv');
# "4" is the value of the "id" column of the CSV row
$csv->data[4] = array('firstname' => 'John', 'lastname' => 'Doe', 'email' => 'john@doe.com');
$csv->save();
```

**Replace field names or set ones if missing**

```php
$csv = new ParseCsv\Csv();
$csv->fields = ['id', 'name', 'category']
$csv->parse('data.csv');
```

**Add row/entry to end of CSV file**

_Only recommended when you know the exact structure of the file._

```php
$csv = new ParseCsv\Csv();
$csv->save('data.csv', array(array('1986', 'Home', 'Nowhere', '')), true);
```

**Convert 2D array to CSV data and send headers to browser to treat output as
a file and download it**

```php
$csv = new ParseCsv\Csv();
$csv->output('movies.csv', $array, array('field 1', 'field 2'), ',');
```

For more complex examples, see the ``tests`` and `examples` directories.
