parseCSV 0.4.3 beta
-----------------------------------
Date: 1-July-2008

- Issue #4. Added an option for setting sorting
  type behavior when sorting data.
  Simply set $csv->sort_type to "regular", "numeric",
  or "string".

- Issue #6. Raw loaded file data is now cleared from
  file_data property when it has been successfully
  parsed to keep parseCSV's memory footprint to a
  minimum. Specifically handy when using mulitple
  instances of parseCSV to process large files.

-----------------------------------


parseCSV 0.4.2 beta
-----------------------------------
Date: 31-May-2008

- IMPORTANT! If you're using the output(),
  method please note that the first parameter
  has been completely removed as it was
  technically just useless. Instead, the second
  parameter (filename) doubles as its replacement.
  Simply put, if filename is not set or null, the
  output() method will not output a downloadable
  file. Please update your existing code
  when using 0.4.2 and later :)

- Small fix to the headers sent by the output()
  method.

- Added a download example using the output()
  method to the examples folder.

-----------------------------------


parseCSV 0.4.1 beta
-----------------------------------
Date: 29-May-2008

- Fixed a small bug in how the output() method
  handles input data.

-----------------------------------


parseCSV 0.4 beta
-----------------------------------
Date: 11-Apr-2008

- Error reporting for files/data which is corrupt
  or has formatting errors like using double
  quotes in a field without enclosing quotes. Or
  not escaping double quotes with a second one.

- parse() method does not require input anymore
  if the "$object->file" property has been set.

I'm calling this a beta release due to the heavy
modifications to the core parsing logic required
for error reporting to work. I have tested the
new code quite extensively, I'm fairly confident
that it still parses exactly as it always has.

The second reason I'm calling it a beta release
is cause I'm sure the error reporting code will
need more refinements and tweaks to detect more
types of errors, as it's only picking two types
or syntax errors right now. However, it seems
these two are the most common errors that you
would be likely to come across.

parseCSV 0.3.2
-----------------------------------
Date: 1-Apr-2008

This is primarily a bug-fix release for a critical
bug which was brought to my attention.

- Fixed a critical bug in conditions parsing which
  would generate corrupt matching patterns causing
  the condition(s) to not work at all in some
  situations.

- Fixed a small code error which would cause PHP to
  generate a invalid offset notice when zero length
  values were fed into the unparse() method to
  generate CSV data from an array.

Notice: If you have been using the "parsecsv-stable"
branch as an external in any of your projects,
please use the "stable/parsecsv" branch from this
point on as I will eventually remove the former due
to it's stupid naming.

-----------------------------------


parseCSV 0.3.1
-----------------------------------
Date: 1-Sep-2007

- Small change to default output settings to
  conform with RFC 4180 (http://rfc.net/rfc4180.html).
  Only the LF (line feed) character was used
  by default to separate rows, rather than
  CRLF (carriage return & line feed).

-----------------------------------


parseCSV 0.3.0
-----------------------------------
Date: 9-Aug-2007

- Changed to the MIT license.

- Added offset and limit options.

- Added SQL-like conditions for quickly
  filtering out entries. Documentation on the
  condition syntax is forthcoming.

- Small parsing modification to comply
  with some recent changes to the specifications
  outlined on Wikipedia's Comma-separated values
  article.

- Minor changes and optimizations, and a few
  spelling corrections. Oops :)

- Included more complex code examples in the
  parseCSV download.

-----------------------------------


parseCSV 0.2.1
-----------------------------------
Date: 8-Aug-2007

- Fixed stupid code which caused auto function
  to not work in some situations.

-----------------------------------


parseCSV 0.2.0 beta
-----------------------------------
Date: 2-Jan-2007

- Added auto() function to automatically detect
  delimiter character.
  Useful for user upload incase delimiter is
  comma (,), tab, or semi-colon (;). Some
  versions of MS Excel for Windows use
  semi-colons instead of commas when saving to
  CSV files.
  It uses a process of elimination to eliminate
  characters that can not be the delimiter,
  so it should work on all CSV-structured files
  almost no matter what the delimiter is.

- Generally updated some of the core workings
  to increase performance, and offer better 
  support for large (1MB and up) files.

- Added code examples to header comment.
